# **Overview of Templating Engines in Express.js**

Templating engines are tools that allow developers to generate HTML dynamically using template files. They help in rendering views in web applications by combining HTML with data, enabling the creation of dynamic pages. In Express.js, templating engines play a crucial role in generating HTML responses that can be sent to clients.

## **1. Role of Templating Engines in Express.js**

Templating engines help separate the logic of an application from its presentation. This separation of concerns allows developers to build more maintainable and scalable applications. Key roles of templating engines in Express.js include:

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Templating engines allow for the insertion of dynamic data into HTML templates, enabling the creation of personalized and interactive user interfaces.
- **Reusable Templates**: Developers can create reusable templates, which help maintain a consistent look and feel across different pages of the application.
- **Simplified Syntax**: Templating engines often provide a simplified syntax for conditional rendering, looping, and including partials, making it easier to write and read code.
- **Integration with Express**: Most templating engines are designed to work seamlessly with Express.js, allowing for easy configuration and usage.

### **2. Popular Templating Engines**

#### **2.1. Pug (formerly Jade)**

Pug is a high-performance templating engine that uses a clean and minimalistic syntax. It emphasizes indentation-based structure and is widely used in Express.js applications.

- **Key Features**:
  - Minimalist syntax with no closing tags.
  - Supports mixins and includes for reusable components.
  - Great for writing HTML quickly and efficiently.

**Example of Pug Template**:

```pug
doctype html
html
  head
    title My Pug Page
  body
    h1 Welcome to My Website
    p This is a paragraph.
    ul
      each item in items
        li= item
```

**Setting Up Pug in Express.js**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set Pug as the templating engine
app.set('view engine', 'pug');

// Example route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const items = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 'Item 3'];
  res.render('index', { items });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

#### **2.2. EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**

EJS is a simple templating engine that allows you to embed JavaScript code directly within your HTML. It is known for its flexibility and ease of use.

- **Key Features**:
  - Simple syntax for embedding JavaScript in HTML.
  - Supports partials, layouts, and includes.
  - Ideal for applications where JavaScript-heavy rendering is needed.

**Example of EJS Template**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title><%= title %></title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to <%= title %></h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <ul>
    <% items.forEach(function(item) { %>
      <li><%= item %></li>
    <% }); %>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

**Setting Up EJS in Express.js**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Set EJS as the templating engine
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

// Example route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const items = ['Item A', 'Item B', 'Item C'];
  res.render('index', { title: 'My EJS Page', items });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

#### **2.3. Handlebars**

Handlebars is a popular templating engine that provides a simple way to build semantic templates. It is an extension of the Mustache template language and emphasizes logic-less templates.

- **Key Features**:
  - Logic-less templates with helpers for dynamic content.
  - Supports partials for reusable components.
  - Strong community support and various plugins available.

**Example of Handlebars Template**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{title}}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to {{title}}</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  <ul>
    {{#each items}}
      <li>{{this}}</li>
    {{/each}}
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

**Setting Up Handlebars in Express.js**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const exphbs = require('express-handlebars');
const app = express();

// Set Handlebars as the templating engine
app.engine('handlebars', exphbs());
app.set('view engine', 'handlebars');

// Example route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const items = ['Item X', 'Item Y', 'Item Z'];
  res.render('home', { title: 'My Handlebars Page', items });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
